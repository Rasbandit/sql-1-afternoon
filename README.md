# Project Summary

In this project we will be practicing inserting and querying data using SQL. We'll make use of an existing database called DVD rental that can be downloaded here <a href="http://www.postgresqltutorial.com/postgresql-sample-database/">Click me</a>

## Setup

- Once you have downloaded the `.zip` extract the file from it, and it should be a `.tar` file.
- Right click your local database and create a new database called dvd_rental.
- Then right click your new `dvd_rental` database and select restore.
- Make sure the format is `Custom or tar` then select the button on the right of Filename with the three dots `...` inside it.
- This will open a file explorer, you will need to navigate to where you extracted the `dvd_rental.tar` file.
    - Make sure you change the Format: to all files in the bottom right.
- Once you have found your file press select
- Then press restore.
- you should now have all the tables you need for todays afternoon project.

## Table - people

### Instructions

1. Create a table called `person` that records a `person`'s `id`, `name`, `age`, `height` ( in cm ), `city`, `favorite_color`.
    * `id` should be a SERIAL PRIMARY KEY
2. Add 5 different people into the `person` table.
    * Remember to not include the `id` because it should auto-increment.
3. List all the people in the `person` table by `height` from tallest to shortest.
4. List all the people in the `person` table by `height` from shortest to tallest.
5. List all the people in the `person` table by `age` from oldest to youngest.
6. List all the people in the `person` table older than `age` 20.
7. List all the people in the `person` table that are exactly 18 years old.
8. List all the people in the `person` table that are less than 20 years old and older than 30.
9. List all the people in the `person` table that are not 27 (Use not equals).
10. List all the people in the `person` table where their `favorite_color` is not red.
11. List all the people in the `person` table where their `favorite_color` is not red and is not blue.
12. List all the people in the `person` table where their `favorite_color` is orange or green.
13. List all the people in the `person` table where their `favorite_color` is orange, green or blue (use IN).
14. List all the people in the `person` table where their `favorite_color` is yellow or purple (use IN).
